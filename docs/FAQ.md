## Troubleshooting

### My code isn't running properly
Try these steps:
1. Check for syntax errors (red underlines in editor)
2. Clear your browser cache and reload
3. Try running in an incognito/private window
4. Check the browser console for error messages
5. Ensure you're using a supported browser version

### I lost my project!
If your project disappeared:
1. Check if you're in the same browser/device
2. Look in browser developer tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if you accidentally deleted it
5. Look for any browser cleanup/privacy tools that might clear data

### The editor is slow or unresponsive
To improve performance:
1. Close unused tabs in CodeSpace
2. Close other browser tabs to free memory
3. Restart your browser
4. Check if browser extensions are interfering
5. Try using a different browser

### Code execution is not working
If code won't execute:
1. Check for syntax errors in your code
2. Ensure you've selected the correct language
